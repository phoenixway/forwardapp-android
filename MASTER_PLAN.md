# Master Plan

## Feature: Reorderable Child Projects in Backlog

- [x] **Phase 1: Investigation**
    - [x] Investigate how child projects are currently displayed in the backlog.
    - [x] Identify the code responsible for fetching and displaying child projects.
    - [x] Analyze the existing drag-and-drop mechanism for regular sub-projects.
    - [x] Determine how to adapt the existing mechanism for child projects.

- [x] **Phase 2: Implementation**
    - [x] Modify the data source for the backlog to include child projects in a way that they can be reordered.
    - [x] Update the UI to make child projects draggable.
    - [x] Implement the logic to save the new order of child projects.

- [x] **Phase 3: Verification**
    - [x] Test the reordering of child projects in the backlog.
    - [x] Test that the new order is saved and restored correctly.
    - [x] Test that there are no regressions in the existing drag-and-drop functionality.
