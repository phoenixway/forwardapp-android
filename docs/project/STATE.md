# ForwardApp Project State

Status: CANONICAL

This document records only confirmed current project state.

Do not copy assumptions, old plans, or unverified TODOs into this file.

## Repository boundaries

- The parent ForwardApp repository contains the Android/shared codebase.
- `apps/day-goals-desktop/` is a separate Git repository and is intentionally
  ignored by the parent repository.

## Documentation system

- `AGENTS.md` is authoritative for engineering rules.
- `docs/README.md` is authoritative for documentation structure and status.
- `docs/governance/WEBCHAT.md` is authoritative for ChatGPT web workflow.
- `docs/project/*` is the canonical project-memory layer.

## Current architecture

Current architecture has not yet been fully consolidated into this document.

Until that consolidation is evidence-based, use focused documentation plus
current code and persisted contracts to establish subsystem behavior.

### Recurrence-v2 shared domain ownership

The canonical recurrence-v2 model is owned by `shared-core-data-models`.

Cross-client recurrence semantics are owned by `shared-core-domain`, including:

- recurrence rule matching;
- series schedule/lifecycle matching;
- logical occurrence identity;
- deterministic physical occurrence identity;
- recurrence materialization semantics.

Android and Desktop use platform adapters around the shared KMP model/domain.
Those adapters translate persistence/platform representations and do not own
recurrence business rules.

Desktop keeps plain serializable persistence/UI objects at its platform
boundary. Its production recurrence materializer delegates planning to the
shared KMP materializer and only applies the returned plan to Desktop storage
collections. The previous handwritten Desktop TypeScript materialization
engine is no longer on the production path.

A materialized recurrence occurrence is a `DayTask` or `DayFocusItem` carrying
canonical recurrence provenance. There is no separately persisted canonical
Occurrence entity.

Legacy recurrence-v1 runtime and compatibility code remains transitional debt
and must not become recurrence-v2 domain truth.

## Known documentation constraint

A significant amount of older documentation is still unclassified or mixed.
Historical plans must not be interpreted as proof that work is currently
implemented or still pending.
